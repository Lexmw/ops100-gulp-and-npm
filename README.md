This project demonstrates how to use Gulp to create new file, execute javascript and CSS tasks. 
1. The first step to doing this is making sure that you have the updated versions of GULP, Node 
and NPM, without the update versions it may not work.
2. The second step would be to begin writing the correct lines of code and to make sure the 
correct diction is there.
